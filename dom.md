**we can think of the DOM as a piece of land and JavaScript as another piece of land. Both connected via a toll bridge.**

All your JavaScript code that doesn't require a page - code such as loops, ifs, variables, functions and objects - lives in JavaScript Land. Anything that starts with 'document.*' lives in DOMLand. Whenever your JavaScript needs to access the DOM, you need to cross that bridge to DOMlandia. 

>The bad part is that it's a toll bridge and you have to pay a fee every time you cross. 
>So, the more you cross that bridge, the more you pay your performance toll.

DOM access and manipulations is probably the most expensive (slowing down) activity you do in your JavaScript, followed by layouting (reflowing and painting activities). 

## What is HTML DOM.

The document object represents your web page. If you want to access/manipulate any element in an HTML page, you always start with accessing the document object. **All HTML elements are defined as objects.**

## DOM Programming Interface.
The HTML DOM can be accessed with JavaScript and any other programming languages.
The programming interface is the properties and methods of each object.

>*A property* is a **value** that you can get or set 
>(like changing the content of an HTML element).
>*A method* is an **action** you can do. 
>(like add or deleting an HTML element).
