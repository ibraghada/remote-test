###JavaScript & DOM.

![alt text](http://www.phpied.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/domlandia.png "**JavaScript and DOM**")

**we can think of the DOM as a piece of land and JavaScript as another piece of land. Both connected via a toll bridge.**
*www.phpied.com/dom-access-optimization/*

All your JavaScript code that doesn't require a page - code such as loops, ifs, variables, functions and objects - lives in JavaScript Land. Anything that starts with 'document.*' lives in DOMLand. Whenever your JavaScript needs to access the DOM, you need to cross that bridge to DOMlandia. 

>The bad part is that it's a toll bridge and you have to pay a fee every time you cross. 
>So, the more you cross that bridge, the more you pay your performance toll.

## What is HTML DOM.

The document object represents your web page. If you want to access/manipulate any element in an HTML page, you always start with accessing the document object. 
**All HTML elements are defined as objects.**

## DOM Programming Interface variables.

The HTML DOM can be accessed with JavaScript and any other programming languages.

**The programming interface is the properties and methods of each object.**
>*A property* is a **value** that you can get or set 
>(like changing the content of an HTML element).
>*A method* is an **action** you can do. 
>(like add or deleting an HTML element).

##What is manipulating DOM.

DOM access and manipulations is probably the most expensive (slowing down) activity you do in your JavaScript, followed by layouting (reflowing and painting activities).
